    <p>HOW TO HANDLE A CHEATING PARTNER
Being cheated on is an awful feeling, but how you handle it can have a big part in your recovery process. Good people make bad choices and if they are truly sorry and can make amends, forgiveness can lead to an even better relationship. When a partner is unfaithful, it is a serious breach of trust. It may indicate that this person is not worthy or capable of a healthy relationship. On the other hand, if you simply cannot trust that person again, the relationship is effectively dead. 
Well-meaning friends and relatives may want to give simple advice to make a quick, definitive decision. Be aware that you do not have to make a decision right away in most cases. It is your life. Understand the nature of your partner’s cheating. People cheat for many different reasons and it is not always about sex. Sometimes people cheat because they are seeking an emotional connection, trying to deal with a loss or crisis, or seeking an escape. However this is not an excuse or reason for the behavior.
Some key things to consider: Is your partner truly sorry? Did they voluntarily tell you, or did you find out from someone else? Has this sort of behavior happened before, or has he or she promised to not do it, and it has continued or gotten worse? Is this part of a larger picture of poor behavior towards you? Is your partner willing to take steps to mend the relationship (if you decide you want to go that route) such as going for marital counseling, quitting a job, moving, etc.? Do you feel you want to trust this person again? There is no right or wrong answer for this. This is entirely up to the person who has been cheated on. It does not matter if the person who has cheated is sorry, made amends, and so on — this can be a deal breaker plain and simple. Feelings may change with time and further experience with the cheating partner may go one way or the other. This is natural. The way you handle it would determine your next line of action on the relationship. Whether you try to rebuild the relationship or you decide to end things, learn how you can heal and move on. Here are methods to handling a cheating partner
