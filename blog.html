    <p>HOW TO HANDLE A CHEATING PARTNER
Being cheated on is an awful feeling, but how you handle it can have a big part in your recovery process. Good people make bad choices and if they are truly sorry and can make amends, forgiveness can lead to an even better relationship. When a partner is unfaithful, it is a serious breach of trust. It may indicate that this person is not worthy or capable of a healthy relationship. On the other hand, if you simply cannot trust that person again, the relationship is effectively dead. 
Well-meaning friends and relatives may want to give simple advice to make a quick, definitive decision. Be aware that you do not have to make a decision right away in most cases. It is your life. Understand the nature of your partner’s cheating. People cheat for many different reasons and it is not always about sex. Sometimes people cheat because they are seeking an emotional connection, trying to deal with a loss or crisis, or seeking an escape. However this is not an excuse or reason for the behavior.
Some key things to consider: Is your partner truly sorry? Did they voluntarily tell you, or did you find out from someone else? Has this sort of behavior happened before, or has he or she promised to not do it, and it has continued or gotten worse? Is this part of a larger picture of poor behavior towards you? Is your partner willing to take steps to mend the relationship (if you decide you want to go that route) such as going for marital counseling, quitting a job, moving, etc.? Do you feel you want to trust this person again? There is no right or wrong answer for this. This is entirely up to the person who has been cheated on. It does not matter if the person who has cheated is sorry, made amends, and so on — this can be a deal breaker plain and simple. Feelings may change with time and further experience with the cheating partner may go one way or the other. This is natural. The way you handle it would determine your next line of action on the relationship. Whether you try to rebuild the relationship or you decide to end things, learn how you can heal and move on.

        <p> <h3>WORLD FRIENDSHIP DAY / INTERNATIONAL DAY OF FRIENDSHIP 2019</h3>
World Friendship Day, also known as International Day of Friendship takes place on 30th July. The original idea for a day of friendship came from Hallmark cards in the 1930’s. Originally celebrated on 2nd August, the day was largely viewed cynically by the public as a money making exercise, sales of friendship day cards did not take off in Europe and by the mid-1940’s the day had faded into obscurity in the USA. The idea of a day to honour friendship was, however, adopted by a number of countries in Asia where it remained a popular custom to reserve a day for celebrating friendships and the exchange of gifts between friends. The first World Friendship Day was proposed for 30 July 1958 by the World Friendship Crusade, an international civil organization that campaigns to foster a culture of peace through friendship. Many years later, in 2011, the 30th July was declared as the International Day of Friendship by the General Assembly of United Nations. With the growing popularity of social media throughout the world, there has been an increase in celebrating World Friendship day and International Day of Friendship online as well as with community activities in local communities aimed at bringing those of different backgrounds together. july 30 2019
